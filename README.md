# StudyOptima Repository

Welcome to **StudyOptima**, the award-winning academic time management platform that secured **first place in the Big Digital Pitch Competition 2023**!

**StudyOptima** is designed to transform how students manage their study time, offering personalized strategies that boost academic performance. Addressing the challenge that 73% of students find time management crucial yet only 3% effectively manage their schedules, StudyOptima utilizes **AI** and **data analysis** to create tailored study plans based on personal abilities and course requirements.

#### Key Features:
- **User-friendly platform** with intuitive study planners
- **AI-powered personalized plans** that adapt to individual progress
- **Course-specific study plans** to meet different academic needs
- **Goal setting & time allocation tools** to optimize study time
- **Progress tracking & adaptability** for ongoing improvement

After the competition, we enhanced the project with a **chatbot** to provide additional support. The chatbot acts as a study assistant, answering questions and offering study tips to ensure a more interactive and productive experience. You can access it [here](https://studyoptima.zapier.app/). The chatbot is currently in its **beta phase**, so you may encounter some flaws. Feel free to contact me or send feedback to help improve it!
